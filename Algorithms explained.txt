1. Decision Tree Algorithm: A decision tree algorithm is used to create a decision tree model by learning a set of rules from a dataset. It is used for classification and regression tasks. 

2. Naive Bayes Algorithm: This algorithm is used for classification tasks, where it uses the probability of each attribute belonging to a particular class to make a prediction.

3. K-Means Clustering Algorithm: This algorithm is used for unsupervised learning tasks, where it clusters data points into distinct groups based on similar characteristics.

4. Artificial Neural Networks: This algorithm is used to create models that are inspired by the workings of the brain. It is used for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.

5. Support Vector Machines: This algorithm is used for classification and regression tasks, where it creates a hyperplane to separate data points into distinct categories.

6. Random Forest Algorithm: This algorithm is used for both classification and regression tasks, where it creates multiple decision trees and combines their results to make a prediction.

7. Logistic Regression: This algorithm is used for classification tasks, where it creates an equation to predict the probability of a particular outcome.

8. Gradient Boosting Algorithm: This algorithm is used for both classification and regression tasks, where it creates multiple weak models and combines their results to make a prediction.

9. Genetic Algorithms: This algorithm is used for optimization tasks, where it uses a process of evolution to find the best solution.

10. Reinforcement Learning: This algorithm is used for learning tasks, where it uses rewards to learn how to complete a task.


Quicksort is a way to sort a list of numbers. It starts by picking a number from the list and then splitting the list into two parts: one part with numbers smaller than the number you picked, and another part with numbers bigger than the number you picked. Then it sorts the two parts separately, and finally it joins them back together into one sorted list.


1. Line 1: Define a function named quicksort that takes a list of values as an argument.

2. Line 2: If the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, return the list as it is.

3. Line 3: Set the pivot element to be the middle element of the list.

4. Line 4: Create a new list called left that contains all the elements in the list that are less than the pivot.

5. Line 5: Create a new list called middle that contains all the elements in the list that are equal to the pivot.

6. Line 6: Create a new list called right that contains all the elements in the list that are greater than the pivot.

7. Line 7: Return the result of quicksorting the left list, followed by the middle list, followed by the result of quicksorting the right list.

This is the process that is followed by the quicksort algorithm to sort a list of values.


Binary search

1. low = 0: This sets the lower boundary of the search to the first item in the array.
2. high = len(array) - 1: This sets the upper boundary of the search to the last item in the array.
3. mid = (low + high) // 2: This sets the middle index of the array by adding the lower and upper boundaries and dividing by 2.
4. guess = array[mid]: This sets the value of guess to the item in the array at the index of mid.
5. if guess == item: This is the base case that checks if the item has been found and if so, returns the index of the item.
6. if guess > item: This checks if the guess is greater than the item, and if so, sets the upper boundary of the search to one index lower than the middle.
7. else: This runs if the guess is not greater than the item and sets the lower boundary of the search to one index higher than the middle.
8. return mid: This returns the index of the item.


Path finding
   while len(open_list) > 0:
        current = open_list[0]
        current_index = 0
        for index, item in enumerate(open_list):
            if item.f < current.f:
                current = item
                current_index = index

        open_list.pop(current_index)
        closed_list.append(current)

        if current == goal:
            return reconstruct_path(current)

        for neighbour in graph[current]:
            tentative_g = current.g + neighbour.cost

            if neighbour in closed_list and tentative_g >= neighbour.g:
                continue

            if neighbour in open_list and tentative_g >= neighbour.g:
                continue

            neighbour.g = tentative_g
            neighbour.h = heuristic(neighbour, goal)
            neighbour.f = neighbour.g + neighbour.h

            if neighbour not in open_list:
                open_list.append(neighbour)


Line 1:  creates an empty list called open_list and an empty list called closed_list, which will be used to store the nodes in the graph.

Line 2:  sets the g, h, and f values of start to 0. g is the cost of reaching a node from the start, h is the heuristic cost of reaching the goal from the node, and f is the total cost of reaching the goal from the node.

Line 3:  adds the start node to the open_list.

Line 4:  runs an infinite loop while the open_list is not empty.

Line 5:  sets the current variable to the first node in the open_list and sets the current_index variable to 0. This is done so that we can reference the current node and its index in the open_list.

Line 6: This loop iterates through each node in the open_list and sets the current variable to the node with the lowest f value. It also sets the current_index variable to the index of the node with the lowest f value in the open_list.

Line 7:  removes the current node from the open_list.

Line 8:  adds the current node to the closed_list.

Line 9:  checks if the current node is the goal node. If it is, then it returns the path to the goal by calling the reconstruct_path() function.

Line 10: This loop iterates through each neighbour of the current node.

Line 11: This sets the tentative_g variable to the cost of reaching the neighbour node from the current node.

Line 12:  checks if the neighbour node is in the closed_list and if the tentative_g cost is greater than or equal to the g cost of the neighbour node. If it is, then the loop continues to the next neighbour node.

Line 13:  checks if the neighbour node is in the open_list and if the tentative_g cost is greater than or equal to the g cost of the neighbour node. If it is, then the loop continues to the next neighbour node.

Line 14: sets the g cost of the neighbour node to the tentative_g cost.

Line 15:  sets the h cost of the neighbour node to the heuristic cost of reaching the goal node from the neighbour node.

Line 16: sets the f cost of the neighbour node to the g cost plus the h cost.

Line 17:  checks if the neighbour node is in the open_list. If it isn't, then it adds it to the open_list.

Line 18:  ends the loop for each neighbour of the current node.

Line 19:  ends the infinite loop when the open_list is empty.

Line 20:  ends the a_star_search() function.
