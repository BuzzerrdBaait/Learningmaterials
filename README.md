"Learning Materials"

  is a repository containing some of my favorite, or most referenced notes!
  
  Algorithms explained is my attempt to work through advanced concepts and explain them in a listenable way. It is written in a descriptive way that is best utilized by listening to it with any text to speech technology.
  
  "All_modules_and_dunders", is a list of all python and dunders with an explanation beside it. It is hash tagged so I am able to put it in my code when I start developing. To me, this is easier than having typehint because I can see more possible solutions to problems. You can also listen to this one as an audio book.
  
  "SQL Queries" is a basic start to about any database creation. I can copy the file and start programming on a new database right away with this one.
